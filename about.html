                <!-- greeting -->
                <p>Dear Admissions Committee,</p>

                <!-- introduction paragraph -->
                <p>
                    I am writing to express my strong interest in Computation Arts at Concordia. This program aligns
                    perfectly with my lifelong passion for art and technology, and I am eager for the opportunity to
                    contribute my creativity and technical skills to this institution.
                </p>

                <!-- background paragraph -->
                <p>
                    From an early age, art has been an integral part of my life, a passion instilled in me by my
                    grandfather.
                    Over the years, I have explored various artistic mediums: drawing, painting, animation,
                    photography, videography, and graphic, sound, web, and game design. Simultaneously, I have been
                    deeply
                    fascinated by computers, building four PCs to date and continuously expanding my knowledge of their
                    inner workings.
                    My enthusiasm for technology has driven me to self-learn coding, asset swapping, and retexturing to
                    modify video games from a young age,
                    as well as mastering software such as Adobe, Blender, Krita, Unreal Engine, and various film, photo,
                    and audio editing programs.
                </p>

                <!-- intersection of art & technology -->
                <p>
                    The intersection of art and technology is where I thrive. Whether creating digital paintings with a
                    tablet,
                    producing 2D animations, experimenting with stop-motion techniques, or creating interactive scripts
                    and games,
                    I find immense fulfillment in using computers as a creative tool. My dedication to my craft is
                    unwavering,
                    I approach each project with focus, determination, and a drive to push creative boundaries.
                </p>

                <!-- why the program fits -->
                <p>
                    When I discovered Computation Arts, I knew it was the perfect fit for my skills, interests, and
                    aspirations.
                    So much so that I worked hard to charm my way into a few courses in my first two semesters at
                    Concordia.
                    The curriculum and opportunities offered by your program are precisely what I have been seeking to
                    further my education and professional development. I am confident that my creativity, technical
                    expertise,
                    and strong work ethic will allow me to excel in this program and make meaningful contributions to
                    the
                    university community.
                </p>

                <!-- closing paragraph -->
                <p>
                    I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration. I would be honored to be a part of this
                    fantastic
                    program and look forward to the possibility of contributing my talents. Please do not hesitate to
                    contact
                    me if you require any further information. Also, last semester Sabine allowed me to have her as a
                    reference and squeezed me into her 263, she's a gem.
                </p>
